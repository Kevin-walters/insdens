Title: Calculate Posterior Probability of Gene Essentiality
Version: 0.0.0.9000
Author: Kevin Walters
Maintainer: Kevin Walters <k.walters@sheffield.ac.uk>
Description: The package Uses Bacterial gene-level insertion density and 
    specific priors to calculate the posterior probability that each gene is 
    essential, for a given set of bacterial genes provided. It uses Markov 
    chain Monte Carlo to sample values of the posterior probabilities. The 
    paper that gives the details of the exact MCMC approach taken is 
    "Probabilistic Identification of Bacterial Essential Genes via insertion 
    density using TraDIS Data with Tn5 libraries" by Nlebedim, 
    Chaudhuri and Walters (2021).
